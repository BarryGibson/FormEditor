# Working with the form submissions
Most of the time you'll probably just work with the form submissions in the Umbraco back office. But once in a while you might want to use the form submissions in frontend, and Form Editor offers several options for that.

## Listing form submissions
You can get the form submissions if you'd like to list them - [read more](submissions_list.md).

## Form submission statistics
You can access statistics for the form submissions if you've enabled it - [read more](submissions_stats.md).

## Editing a form submission
You can load a form submission and edit the submitted values - [read more](submissions_edit.md).
